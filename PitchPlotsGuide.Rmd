This is the guide for using Pitch Plots in ggshakeR.

These plots aim to plot events on a pitch hence the name...Pitch Plots! 

Currently, ggshakeR houses 7 Pitch Plots:

* `plot_pass()`
* `plot_heatmap()`
* `plot_sonar()`
* `plot_passflow()`
* `plot_shot()`
* `plot_convexhull`
* `plot_passnet`

Let's learn simple guides on how to use them!

# Understat

## `plot_shot()`

Characteristics:

* Only works with [Understat](https://understat.com/) data
* Has three types: hexbin, density, or point (default)

The easiest Pitch Plot function to use! To use this function, which *only works with Understat data*, we need the [understatr package](https://github.com/ewenme/understatr).

Once you have installed the package, put the package in your work session by writing:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(understatr)
```

We will use the understatr package to get the data for `plot_shot()`. Browse through the understatr package to get their data. As a sanity check, make sure the dataframe has columns with these names:

* `X` (not x)
* `Y` (not y)
* `xG`
* `result`
* `name`

Here, I am going to get Mohammed Salah's data. To learn more about how to get data, read [Nandy's excellent guide](https://sagnikdas1.medium.com/tabguide-1-making-shot-maps-1c030f08393e).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
shot_data <- get_player_shots(player_id = 1250) # Salah's `player_id` on understat is `1250`
```

After that, simply write and execute the following code to get a beautiful shot map:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot <- plot_shot(shot_data, type = "density")
plot
```

An additional feature is provided through a couple of other arguments within the function in the form of **highlight_goals** and **avg_loc**. Use them by toggling between *TRUE* and *FALSE*.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

plot <- plot_shot(shot_data, highlight_goals = TRUE, avg_loc = FALSE)
plot
```

Note that, you can write hexbin, density, and point to get three different types of shot maps. However, the **highlight_goals** parameter only works for point shot maps. Try it out!

# Opta & StatsBomb

## `plot_sonar()`, `plot_heatmap()`, & `plot_passflow()`

These three functions are quite similar in what they require.

* `plot_sonar()` gives you a pass sonar
* `plot_heatmap()` gives you a heat map on the pitch
* `plot_passflow()` gives you a pass flow map on the pitch

Here are some key things to know:

* `plot_sonar()` and `plot_passflow()` expect passing data
* All three functions require the data to have at minimum four columns named: __x, y, finalX, finalY__
* All three functions work on either Opta or Statsbomb data
* All three functions need a minimum of 4 columns named:
  + `x` (indicates starting x location)
  + `y` (indicates starting y location)
  + `finalX` (indicates ending x location for passes)
  + `finalY` (indicates ending y location for passes)
  
Let's first get some data! You can either import you data or use [Statsbomb's open free dataset](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data)

In this example, I'll be using Statsbomb's Messi Data for LaLiga 2014/15:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(StatsBombR)

Comp <- FreeCompetitions() %>%
  filter(competition_id == 11 & season_name == "2014/2015")
Matches <- FreeMatches(Comp)
StatsBombData <- StatsBombFreeEvents(MatchesDF = Matches, Parallel = TRUE)
plotting_data  <- allclean(StatsBombData)
```

Before plotting, I am going to rename my columns:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plotting_data <- plotting_data %>%
  rename("x" = "location.x",
         "y" = "location.y",
         "finalX" = "pass.end_location.x",
         "finalY" = "pass.end_location.y")
```

Sweet, let's plot!

### `plot_heatmap()`

For the heat map, we simply select our columns and plot! **Type** options include *bin*, *hex*, *density* and *jdp*. Note that we don't specify __data_type__ since the default is set to "statsbomb", so we can simply write this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
heat_data  <- plotting_data %>%
  select(x, y, finalX, finalY)

heatplot <- plot_heatmap(heat_data, type = "bin")
heatplot
```

### `plot_sonar()`

For the pass sonar, we're going to a bit more data cleaning. I don't want everybody's passing sonar - that's redundant! 

For our purposes, I want Jordi Alba's passing sonar. First, let me get all passes from Jordi Alba:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plotting_data_alba  <- plotting_data %>%
  filter(type.name == "Pass" & team.name == "Barcelona" & player.name == "Jordi Alba Ramos")
```

Now I can construct a pass sonar! Default dataType is set to Statsbomb, so here we can simply write:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sonarPlot <- plot_sonar(plotting_data_alba)
sonarPlot
```

![plot_sonar() of all of Jordi Alba's passes from 2014/15](../man/figures/plot_sonar.png){width=80%}

### `plot_passflow()`

Since we already have Jordi Alba's passes, we can just construct the pass flow like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
passflowPlot <- plot_passflow(plotting_data_alba)
passflowPlot
```

## `plot_convexhull()`

This function allows the user to use event data to plot the convex hulls of multiple or a single player. It works on both Opta and StatsBomb data and requires the following columns:

 + `x`
 + `y`
 + `finalX`
 + `finalY`
 + `playerId` (Player Name's)
 
Let us plot using the dataset we already have. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

unique(plotting_data$match_id) # Find all match ID's from the dataset

convexPlot <- plotting_data %>%
  filter(match_id == 266631) %>%
  plot_convexhull()

```

Note that we do not need to pass any parameters to the function here as the dataset has already been specified and the default **data_type** is set to *statsbomb*. If using Opta data, set the **data_type** as such. Manipulate the dataset as per your needs and use-case. You can also plot a simgle player convex hull by filtering for the specific name in the pipe before applying the function.
